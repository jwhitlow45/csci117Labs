MA (Multiple Answer)
    Code:
        toBList :: [a] -> BList a
        toBList a = toBListHelper a where 
            toBListHelper :: [a] -> BList a
            toBListHelper [] = Nil
            toBListHelper (x:xs) = cons x (toBListHelper xs)

    Which of the following accurately describes the above function 'toBList' in Haskell?
        a)correct: Iterative
