/*
The minimum quantum that will not cause the kernel to suspend is 5.
This is because the thread is only allowed to work on 4 statements
at once with a quantum of 4. There are 4 statements preceeding the
if statement when looking at the elborated syntax in the .out file.
Once the quantum is set to 5 the thread can work on 5 statements at
once and the fifth statement happens to be the if statement. This
causes the if statement to have to wait for B to be bound to
resolve the program suspension.
